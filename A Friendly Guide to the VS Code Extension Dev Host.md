# A Friendly Guide to the VS Code Extension Development Host

So, you've written some code for your extension, and you've been told to press `F5`. Suddenly, a whole new VS Code window pops up! What is this magic?

Don't worry, it's not magicâ€”it's the **Extension Development Host**, and it's your best friend when building extensions.

## What is the Extension Development Host?

Think of it like a **test-drive environment** for your extension.

It's a completely separate, clean instance of VS Code where your extension is automatically installed and running. This allows you to safely test your features exactly as a real user would, without affecting your main development setup.

In short, it's your personal sandbox for playing with and debugging your creation.

## How to Launch It (The Easy Part)

As you've learned, launching it is simple:

1.  Have your extension's project folder open in VS Code.
2.  **Press the `F5` key.**

That's it! A new window will appear, ready for testing. You'll often see `[Extension Development Host]` in the title bar to remind you that you're in test mode.

## How to Test Your Extension in the Host

Once the new window is open, you can test your "AI Commit Message Generator" by following these steps:

1.  In the **Host window**, open a folder that is a Git repository.
2.  Make a change to any file in that folder.
3.  Stage the change (using `git add` or the Source Control panel).
4.  Go to the **Source Control view** (the icon with three connected dots on the left).
5.  Click your shiny **"Generate message with Gemini"** button!

If everything works, you've successfully tested your extension! **Check that the generated message appears in the SCM input box and follows the Conventional Commit format (e.g., starts with `feat:`, `fix:`, etc.).**

## "I Changed My Code. How Do I See the Update?"

This is the most important part of the development cycle. Your changes don't appear live. You need to tell the Host window to reload your extension.

1.  **Compile First:** Go back to your **main project window** (the one with your `.ts` files) and run `npm run compile` in the terminal. This turns your TypeScript into JavaScript that VS Code can understand.

2.  **Reload the Host:** Go to the **Extension Development Host window** (the one you're testing in). Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and type `Developer: Reload Window`, then press Enter.

The Host window will quickly restart, loading the new version of your extension. Now you can test your latest changes!

This **Code -> Compile -> Reload** loop is the fundamental workflow for building and testing VS Code extensions. Happy coding!
